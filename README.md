Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my little corner of the internet!  
This site is built with just **HTML and CSS** and is basically my digital scrapbook. Itâ€™s where I keep my projects, highlights, and cool things Iâ€™ve been up to.  

Whatâ€™s Inside  
- Projects: From science fair experiments to engineering builds, plus activities like Model UN, Debate, and Mock Trial.  
- Entrepreneurship: My PURVedic Soap Kitchen and other creative ventures Iâ€™ve started.  
- Media Features: Articles and shout-outs, like when I was recognized in the **Congressional App Challenge** and **Broadcom Coding with Commitment**.  

Why I Made This  
I wanted a space that goes beyond a rÃ©sumÃ©, basically somewhere to share my projects, ideas, and passions. This site is part portfolio, part journal, and part showcase of what Iâ€™ve been creating.

P.S. my commits are named after periodic table elements (i have one up in my room)
