Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my little corner of the internet!  
This site is built with just **HTML, JS, and CSS** and is basically my digital scrapbook. Itâ€™s where I keep my projects, highlights, and cool things Iâ€™ve been up to.  

Why I Made This  
I wanted a space that goes beyond a rÃ©sumÃ©, basically somewhere to share my projects, ideas, and passions. This site is part portfolio, part journal, and part showcase of what Iâ€™ve been creating.

P.S. my commits are named after periodic table elements (i have one up in my room)
