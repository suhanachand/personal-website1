    title: "A World Without Borders",
    text: `Imagine a world without borders. Envision all people living together in harmony, with no divisions, no prejudices. Each individual would be an Earthling‚Äîno longer labeled as American, Italian, Chinese, or any other nationality. You could travel anywhere freely, without the need for a passport. Nationalism would vanish, armies would be unnecessary, and wars would be a relic of the past. This utopian vision paints an idyllic picture of global peace and unity. However, the reality of achieving such a world is far from simple. Despite the allure of a borderless world, I am convinced that it remains an impractical dream. Even if borders between countries were abolished, the world would not transform into a peaceful paradise. Let us delve deeper into what a real world without borders might look like.

First, consider the implications of having no borders. It would mean the absence of control. Law enforcement agencies would struggle to track down criminals, fugitives, and even refugees. The legal system would lose much of its power, making it nearly impossible for the police to manage the masses. Without borders, strikes and revolutions could escalate uncontrollably, leading to widespread chaos. In such a scenario, the army might become a necessity rather than a relic. The reality is that crime, unfortunately, remains uncontrollable without some form of enforcement, which often includes arms.

Moreover, envisioning a world without borders also involves grappling with the challenge of unifying diverse systems. Countries have unique political systems, legal frameworks, and cultural norms. Merging these into a single global system while respecting all religions, traditions, and customs is a Herculean task. For instance, how could Muslim-majority countries and Christian-majority countries share the same laws while honoring their distinct religious practices? Respecting these differences inherently leads back to the existence of different nations, which in turn implies the need for borders.

In light of these complexities, my vision for a better world involves maintaining borders, but with significant improvements. Countries should retain their sovereignty and manage their internal affairs independently. However, we could strive for greater international cooperation and openness. Imagine a world where imported and exported goods are duty-free, facilitating free trade among nations. Visa-free travel could allow people to live and work in any country they choose, fostering global mobility and cultural exchange.

In conclusion, while our current world is not perfect, it offers a structure that balances order and diversity. The dream of a borderless world remains an alluring yet impractical ideal. Instead, we should focus on enhancing our existing systems to promote cooperation, understanding, and freedom. By enjoying what we have and working towards achievable improvements, we can create a world that, though not utopian, is a better place for all.`,

    title: "Is Racism Still a Problem in the U.S.?",
    text: `Steven O. Roberts once said, "Racism is alive and well," and the truth is, it still is. Racism has been a pervasive problem in the United States for centuries, long before it was recognized as such. The past, the present, and the probable future have all been shaped by the actions and events of racists. From slavery and the Indian Removal Act to present-day systemic racism, minority races have been consistently oppressed and held down by the white and privileged. Racist stereotypes have been perpetuated through major events like the aftermath of 9/11 and the Red Scare, as well as everyday instances of discrimination and prejudice. Society has been deeply ingrained with these beliefs and will continue to affect all age levels. Today‚Äôs reality is that racism persists in various forms, including healthcare disparities, gerrymandering practices, and systemic racism, which will continue to affect marginalized communities disproportionately.

In particular, healthcare disparities based on racial and ethnic backgrounds are one of the root causes of racism in the United States. These disparities have taken a toll on minority groups due to the embedded biases in healthcare facilities. According to CDC.gov, "Black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, highlighting disparities in healthcare access and quality" ("Health Equity"). This bias in the healthcare system results in unfair treatment in critical life-or-death situations. Moreover, "Black and Hispanic patients are less likely to receive opioid analgesia for acute pain in the ED and opioid prescriptions at discharge compared to their white counterparts," (Mac√≠as-Konstantopoulos et al.). This has exposed racially motivated healthcare providers and a pattern of individuals of color receiving inadequate quality and quantity of treatment. In conclusion, healthcare disparities are a crucial issue that contributes to racism in the United States and must be addressed to combat racism effectively.

Furthermore, another pressing issue that affects the United States is the problem of gerrymandering, which undermines the fairness of democracy. Referring to The Atlantic, ‚ÄúThe state Republican-led General Assembly made further tweaks to congressional districts that were already highly gerrymandered and created a web of districts with little geographic coherence, in the process packing more black voters into certain districts and diluting their voting strength in others,‚Äù (Newkirk). This quote implies that gerrymandering is being utilized to minimize the voting influence of minority communities, especially in districts with heavily concentrated black populations. Additionally, as stated by the American Civil Liberties Union, "In Georgia, lawmakers have made it a crime to provide food and water to voters standing in line at the poll lines that are notoriously long in Georgia, especially for communities of color," (‚ÄúFighting Voter Suppression‚Äù). This excerpt directly suggests the unfair bias in the political system, going against the 15th Amendment, due to racism and long-term prejudice. In conclusion, the constancy of racism in the US is evident through systemic bigotries, unequal access to political opportunities and representation, and instances of discrimination experienced by marginalized communities, highlighting the ongoing necessity for significant change to address and eradicate racial biases.

Finally, the argument that racism in the United States is not as prevalent as in the past overlooks several critical factors. While some argue that isolated incidents of racism do occur, the assertion is that racism is not a widespread problem to the extent of past injustices like Jim Crow or redlining. As stated by Forbes writer John McWhorter, "But Obama‚Äôs election showed that one thing these backward people cannot stop is a black family ending up in the White House," (McWhorter). While it is true that overt forms of racism have diminished, systemic racism persists in various aspects of American society. For instance, the argument fails to consider the impact of historical injustices, such as slavery and segregation, which continue to affect black communities today. These injustices have contributed to the widening wealth gap between white and black households, as highlighted by the Pew Research Center. Redlining, for example, ‚ÄúIn dollar amounts, the wealth gap between white households and black and Hispanic households increased from 2019 to 2022,‚Äù (Kochhar). Acknowledging that racism in America is not just about individual attitudes but also about the systemic structures and institutions that perpetuate inequality is crucial. Recognizing whether racism is a problem in the US involves understanding that the primary reason is systemic racism, which manifests in various forms, including wealth disparities. This systemic issue suggests that racism is deeply ingrained in the structures and institutions of society, leading to unequal access to opportunities and resources based on race.

In conclusion, the various perspectives on racism in the United States emphasize the ongoing need for introspection and joint efforts by society. Healthcare disparities, gerrymandering practices, and systemic inequalities highlight the complexities of this issue. Healthcare disparities degrade marginalized communities based on racial prejudice and access to healthcare facilities. Similarly, the issue of gerrymandering demonstrates the unjust basis in the voting system to minimize the voice of minority groups. Systemic racism has entrenched people of color, creating major gaps in society. Ultimately, racism is a problem that will continue to remain a problem unless the US implements a plethora of reforms to create a just society.`,

    title: "Ike-man: Far From Home",
    text: `During my time at the National History Academy, we visited incredible places like battlefields, monuments, and museums that brought the past to life. But the place that completely stole my heart was Eisenhower‚Äôs home in Gettysburg.

It wasn‚Äôt flashy or overly formal. It felt real. The moment I stepped onto the property, I could tell this wasn‚Äôt just a house‚Äîit was his escape. After leading troops through WWII and running a country, Eisenhower chose this peaceful farm as the one place he could always come back to. That idea really resonated with me. We all need a space that grounds us. For Eisenhower, this was it.

Inside, the furniture was a quiet but powerful reminder of the relationships he built. Gifts from world leaders like chairs, tables, and little treasures weren‚Äôt locked behind glass, but actually used in the house. That kind of trust and warmth was everywhere. Eisenhower wasn‚Äôt about show; he was about connection. He invited people‚Äîincluding friends, neighbors, even political opponents‚Äîand made them feel at ease.

And then there was Mamie‚Äîor ‚ÄúMami,‚Äù as he lovingly called her. Her pink rooms were my favorite part. They were soft, pretty, and so full of her presence. It was like a quiet love letter to their relationship. I honestly adored how their love showed up in the details of the house. The balance between his strength and her sweetness felt familiar‚Äîlike how we lean on each other during camp, in small, everyday moments.

What made this house feel even more special to me was how much it reminded me of us‚Äîour NHA group. Singing in the kitchen while making food, volleyball circles in the gym, and late-night laughs in the sleeping porch‚Ä¶ those little things built a kind of home away from home. Just like Eisenhower found comfort in his space, I found it in ours. That parallel made everything click.

Visiting the Eisenhower home wasn‚Äôt just about learning history; it was about feeling it‚Äîand realizing how much a home, a community, and the people you share it with can shape your story.`,
